# Notes regarding implementation
This is a pseudo specification:
- Every class should have a comment and lable parameter
- Many but not all classes have an ID variable
- In the [UML](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/850a6e19-5757-4882-b6bd-cfff3b791f39/LyF_e3kXkNLC), a closed arrow indicates "has A" and an open arrow indicates "Is A"
- Where attributes are shown as equaling x/y/z etc these are instance variables that should be set by the contructor
- Where attributes are not shown as equaliing anything these are class variables that are not set by the contructor but which should be added to the graph on instantiation as blank nodes.  These class variables should all have associated 'set' functions that both alter their value and alter the value in the graph
- In general treat the std as primary authority.  Use the provided UML as a reference primarily for functions
- types are not shown in the UML, use the standard as the authority
- If things are unclear, try looking at the paper, there are some
     examples of architecture that might make things more clear
